By: [Wessel van Tilburg](https://github.com/wesselvantilburg)

## Description

This repository contains my solutions for the Advent of Code 2024 challenges. The challenges can be found on the [Advent of Code website](https://adventofcode.com/2024).

This is the first time I'm participating in the Advent of Code challenges. I'm excited to see how far I can get and how much I can learn from these challenges.

## Progress

| Day | Part 1 | Part 2 |
| --- | ------ | ------ |
| 1   |        |        |

## Usage

Running the code can be done by executing the following command in the terminal:

```bash
bun src/days/01/(one|two).ts
```
