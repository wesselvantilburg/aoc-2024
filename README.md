## Description

This repository contains my solutions for the Advent of Code 2024 challenges. The challenges can be found on the [Advent of Code website](https://adventofcode.com/2024).

This is the first time I'm participating in the Advent of Code challenges. I'm excited to see how far I can get and how much I can learn from these challenges.

| 1   | 🟢     | 🟢     |
| 2   | 🟢     | 🌕     | Part two was not that difficult, but at first I was struggling with all the edge cases. So eventually I just brute-forced the answer :)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 3   | 🟢     | 🟢     | Little RegEx refresher needed, but with RegEx it was easy                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 4   | 🟢     | 🟢     |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 5   | 🟢     | 🟢     |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 6   | 🟢     | 🌕     | Part one was fun and easy, part two was a bit more difficult and very fun. Went with a wrong approach at first, where I thought a loop would be going over the start position in the same direction as the start direction. This was however one way of having a loop, there is more possible loops. After figuring this out (thank you sample input) the puzzle didn't take that long anymore |
