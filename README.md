## Description

This repository contains my solutions for the Advent of Code 2024 challenges. The challenges can be found on the [Advent of Code website](https://adventofcode.com/2024).

This is the first time I'm participating in the Advent of Code challenges. I'm excited to see how far I can get and how much I can learn from these challenges.

## Progress

| Day | Part 1 | Part 2 | Thoughts                                                                                                                                |
| --- | ------ | ------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | 游릭     | 游릭     |
| 2   | 游릭     | 游깻     | Part two was not that difficult, but at first I was struggling with all the edge cases. So eventually I just brute-forced the answer :) |
| 3   | 游릭     | 游릭     | Little RegEx refresher needed, but with RegEx it was easy                                                                               |
